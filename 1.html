  title="greek myths wikipedia">Greek mythology
</a> is the body of <strong>myths originally told by <u>the
   ancient Greeks</u>.</strong>
These stories concern the origin and the nature of the world, the lives and
activities of deities, heroes, and mythological creatures, and the origins
and significance of the ancient Greeks' own cult and ritual practices.</P>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">Modern scholars study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious
and political institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain
 understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.
The Greek myths were initially propagated in an oral-poetic tradition most
 likely by Minoan and Mycenaean singers starting in the 18th century BC;
 eventually the myths of the heroes of the Trojan War and its aftermath became
 part of the oral tradition of Homer's epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey.</p>
