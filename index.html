<h2>Myths</h2>
<img src="myths.jpg" width="70%">
<p>Myth is a folklore genre consisting of narratives or
  stories that play a fundamental role in a society, such as
  foundational tales or origin myths. The main characters in
  myths are usually gods, demigods or supernatural humans.
  Stories of everyday human beings, although often of leaders
  of some type, are usually contained in legends,
   as opposed to myths.</p>
